        <p>Understanding Milestone, How Payment
Works, and Work Agreement.</p>
        </div>

<div class="pb-3">
<p class="font-weight-bold">1. Milestone Funding:</p>
<p>• If you want the service provider to begin
work, you are required to fund the milestone
for that specific task or stage.
+ Your funds will be securely held in instantjob's
escrow system for the duration of the project.</p>
</div>

<div class="pb-3">
<p class="font-weight-bold">2. Release of Fund:</p>
<p>• You have the flexibility to choose when to
release the funds to the service provider.
+ You can release in advance if your service
providers need the money for raw materials
in construction or production industry.</p>
</div>

<div class="pb-3">
<p class="font-weight-bold">3. Prohibition on Direct Money Transfer</p>
<p>• Transferring money directly to service
provider's personal receivables account not
only puts your money at risk but also
constitutes a violation of our terms of service.
 </p>
<p>•  We take these violations seriously and may
take appropriate legal measures to address
them.
 </p>
<p>• To ensure a secure and reliable payment
process, we have implemented a system that
protects your funds and facilitates fair
transactions.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="pb-3">
<p class="font-weight-bold">4. Dispute Resolution:</p>
<p>• Once you release the funds to the service
provider, instantjob will no longer have
control over any disputes that may arise.</p>
<p>• It is important to note that the agreement
and any subsequent dispute resolution will
be solely between you and the service
provider.</p>
</div>

<div class="pb-3">
<p class="font-weight-bold">5. Contract Agreement:</p>
<p>• By funding the milestone, you agree to the
work agreement between you and the
service provider.</p>
<p>• This agreement serves as the basis for
initiating work with the chosen service
provider.</p>
<p>• By funding the milestone, you agree to the
work agreement between you and the
service provider.</p>
